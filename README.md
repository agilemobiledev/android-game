== A Simple Android Example ==
This android app is ready to be built by the CloudBees Jenkins service (http://www.cloudbees.com)


=== Create your build job as a free-style project ===
From the Jenkins UI, choose to create a New Job.  When prompted, choose to use a free-style build project.

=== Configure Source Repository ===
In Source Code Management section, add the URL to this repo (or your forked copy)

=== Configure the Android build steps ===
In the Build section, add an 'Execute shell' build step, with the following command:
{{{
#generate the local.properties file
rm -f local.properties
/opt/android/android-sdk-linux/tools/android update project --path ./
}}}

Add another 'Invoke Ant' build step
- select Ant Version 1.8.1
- set Targets to: debug

=== Save and Build ===
You are now configured to build your Android app.  Click the 'Build Now' button whenever you want to pull your lastest source, and re-build your Android app.
